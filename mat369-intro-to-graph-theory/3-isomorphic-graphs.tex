\section{Isomorphic Graphs}

\subsection{The Definition of Isomorphism}

\subsubsection*{Graph Equality Definition}
Two graphs are \bld{equal}, denoted as $G = H$, if $V(G) = V(H) \tand E(G) = E(H)$.

\subsubsection*{Graph Isomorphic Definition}
Two (labels) graphs $G \tand H$ are \bld{isomorphic}, denoted as $G \cong H$, if they have the same structure, meaning there is a \itl{bijection} $\phi: V(G) \to V(H)$ such that for $u,v \in V(G), \phi(u)\phi(v) \in E(H)$ if and only if $uv \in E(G)$.

\subsubsection*{Isomorphic Degree Theorem}
If $G \cong H$, with isomorphic $\phi: V(G) \to V(H)$, then $\deg_G u = \deg_H \phi(u)$.

\subsubsection*{Isomorphic Degree Corollary}
If $G \cong H$, their degree sequences are equal.

\subsubsection*{Graph Invariants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To prove $G \cong H$, find an isomorphism.
    \item To prove $G \ncong H$, find a graph invariant, where $G \tand H$ differ.
\end{itemize}
\bld{Graph Invariants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Order and Size
    \item Degree Sequence
    \item Cycles
    \item Diameter
    \item $k$ (number of components)
    \item $k$-partite-ness
    \item (Other things)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Adjacency and Non-adjacency under Isomorphism Theorem}
$G \cong H$ if and only if $\overline{G} \cong \overline{H}$.

\subsection{Isomorphism as a Relation}

\subsubsection*{Equivalence Relations and Isomorphism Theorem}
Isomorphism is an equivalence relation.
