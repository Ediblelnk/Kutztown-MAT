\subsection{Graphs and Graph Models}

\subsubsection*{Graph Definition}
A (simple) \bld{graph} is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ is a nonempty set of objects called "vertices"
    \item $E$ is a set containing some two-subsets of $V$ called "edges". $E$ may be empty.
\end{itemize}

Graphs are often represented pictorially. For example consider
\[
    G = (V,E) \twhere V = \{1,2,3,4,5\} \tand E = \{\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4\}\}
\]

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pgfmathsetmacro{\gsize}{2}
    
        \foreach \rank/\elements/\size in {0/{,1,2}/3, 0.5/{5}/3, 1/{,4,3}/3} {
        \foreach[count = \i] \element in \elements {\node (\element) at (\i * \gsize - \size / 2 * \gsize, -\rank * \gsize) {$\element$};}
        }
        \foreach \j/\l in {1/4,2/3,2/4,3/4} {\draw (\j) -- (\l);}
        \node (name) at (-1,0) {$G:$}; %name
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Vertices $1 \tand 4$ are \bld{adjacent} because they are joined by an edge.
    \item Vertex $2$ and edge $2-3$ are \bld{indicent}.
    \item Edges $2-3 \tand 3-4$ are \bld{adjacent}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Order Definition}
The \bld{order} of a graph $G$ is $|V(G)|$, or the number of vertices.

\subsubsection*{Size Definition}
The \bld{size} of a graph $G$ is $|E(G)|$, or the number of edges.
