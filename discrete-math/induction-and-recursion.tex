\section{Induction and Recursion}
\subsection{Sequences}
A \textbf{sequence} is a special type of function in which the domain
is the set of consecutive integers.

When a function is specified as a sequence, using subscripts to denote input
is more common, so $g_k$ is used instead of $g(k)$

A value $g_k$ is called a \textbf{term}, and $k$ is the \textit{index} of $g_k$

For example:
\begin{align*}
  g_1 & = 3.67 & g_2 & = 2.88 \\
  g_3 & = 3.25 & g_4 & = 3.75
\end{align*}
\[
  g(k) = 3.67, 2.88, 3.25, 3.75
\]

An entire sequence is denoted by $\{gk\}$, whereas $g_k$ is used to denote a
single term in the sequence.

A sequence commonly starts with $0$ or $1$, but it could be \textit{any} integer.
\subsubsection*{Finite sequence}
A sequence with a finite domain is a \textbf{finite sequence}.
In a finite sequence, there is an \textit{initial index $m$} and a \textit{final index $n$}.
\subsubsection*{Infinite sequence}
A sequence with an infinite domain is a \textbf{infinite sequence}.
In an infinite sequence, there is an \textit{initial index m} and the sequence
is defined for indices $k \geq m$:
\[
  a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2}, a_{m+3}, \ldots
\]
A sequence can be specified by an \textbf{explicit formula}, such as $d_k = 2^k$
for $k \geq 1$.
\[
  \{d_k\} = 2,4,8,16, \ldots
\]
\subsubsection*{Increasing and Decreasing Sequences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item a sequence is \textit{increasing} if for every two consecutive indices, $k$
        and $k+1$, $a_k < a_{k+1}$
  \item a sequence is \textit{non-decreasing} if for every two consecutive indices, $k$
        and $k+1$, $a_k \leq a_{k+1}$
\end{itemize}
For example,
\begin{align*}
  2 < 4 < 5 < 6          & ~\text{increasing \textit{and} non-decreasing}     \\
  2 \leq 4 \leq 5 \leq 6 & ~\text{non-decreasing \textit{but} not increasing}
\end{align*}
\textit{The same relationship can be said for \textbf{decreasing} and \textbf{non-increasing}}.
\subsubsection*{Geometric Sequences}
A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence of real numbers where each term is found by taking
the previous term and multiplying it by a fixed number called the \textbf{common ratio}.

For example, with an \textit{initial term}: 4, and \textit{common ratio}: $\frac{1}{2}$,
\[
  4,2,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4}, \ldots
\]
\subsubsection*{Arithmetic Sequence}
An \textbf{arithmetic sequence} is a sequence of real numbers where each term after the initial
term is found by taking the previous term and adding a fixed number called the \textbf{common difference}.

For example, with an \textit{initial value}: 2, and \textit{common difference}: 3,
\[
  2,5,8,11, \ldots
\]

\subsection{Recurrence relations}
A rule that defines a term $a_n$ as a function of previous terms in the sequence is called a
\textbf{recurrence relation}

For example,
\begin{align*}
  a_0 & = a~\text{initial value} \\
  a_n & = d + a_{n-1}
\end{align*}
Fibonacci Sequence:
\begin{align*}
  f_0 & = 0                                     \\
  f_1 & = 1                                     \\
  f_n & = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}~\text{for}~n \geq 2 \\
\end{align*}
A \textbf{dynamical system} is a system that changes over time. The state of the system
at any point is determined by a set of well-defined rules that depend on the past states
of the system.
