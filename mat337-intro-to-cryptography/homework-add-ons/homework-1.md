# Homework 1

Do some basic research on some method of invisible [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). It can be one of the methods below or [something different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_steganography_techniques). Specifically:

1. describe how the steganographic method is used, and
1. give an example of the method in practice, if it is feasible (you may demonstrate in class).
    - Ancient ad-hoc techniques
    - Invisible ink
    - Microdots
    - Printer steganography

## Knitting Steganography

This kind of steganography uses messages hidden in the yarn of clothing to transmit messages securely. The way that it works is through the use of two kinds of stitches: a knit stitch, which is smooth and looks like a "v", and a purl stitch which somewhat resembles a horizontal line or slight bump. These two can be used in conjunction to encode a message in morse code into an article of clothing.

An example of this steganography takes place during World War II. Phyllis Latour Doyle, a secret agent for Britain, snuck information to the British using knitting as cover. According to [getpocket.com](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-wartime-spies-who-used-knitting-as-an-espionage-tool), "When the German authorities carefully unraveled such a sweater, the story went, they found the wool thread dotted with many knots. [...] an ordinary loop knot can make the equivalent of a dot and a knot in the figure-eight manner will give you the equivalent of a dash."
