\section{Binary Operations}

\subsubsection*{Definition: Binary Operation}
A \bld{binary operation} $*$ on a set $S$ is a function from $S \times S$ into $S$, $*: S \times S \rightarrow S$. That is, $*$ is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair $(a,b) \in S \times S$ exactly one element $a * b \in S$.

\subsubsection*{Condition 1: Uniquely Defined}
For all $a,b \in S \times S$, $a * b$ must be \bld{uniquely defined}. This means that $*$ cannot be undefined for any $a * b$, and each $a * b$ must have exactly one result, not two or more.

\subsubsection*{Condition 2: Closed under $*$}
$S$ must be \bld{closed} under $*$. That is,
\[
    \forall~ a,b \in S, \qquad a * b \in S.
\]

\subsubsection*{Definition: Commutative}
A binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ is commutative if
\[
    \forall~ a,b \in S, \qquad a * b = b * a.
\]

\subsubsection*{Definition: Associative}
A binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ is associative if
\[
    \forall~ a,b,c \in S, \qquad a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.
\]
