\section{Groups}

\subsubsection*{Definition: Group}
A \bld{group} $\group{G,*}$ is a set $G$ \itl{closed} under the binary operation $*$, such that the following axioms are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[$\mathfrak{G}_1$:] For all $a,c,b \in G$, we have
    \[
        (a*b)*c = a*(b*c). \qquad \bld{associativity of *}
    \]
    \item[$\mathfrak{G}_2$:] There is an element $e$ in $G$ such that for all $x \in G$,
    \[
        e*x=x*e=x. \qquad \bld{identity element $e$ for *}
    \]
    \item[$\mathfrak{G}_3$:] Corresponding to each $a \in G$, there is an element $a'$ in $G$ such that
    \[
        a*a'=a'*a=e. \qquad \bld{inverse $a'$ of $a$}
    \]
\end{enumerate}
Note: $G$ does not \itl{need} to be commutative.

\subsubsection*{Definition: Abelian Group}
A group $G$ is \bld{Abelian} if its binary operation is \bld{commutative}.
