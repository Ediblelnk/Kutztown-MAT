\section{Cyclic Groups}

\subsubsection*{Recall}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $G$ is a group, $a \in G$, and $G = \{a^n : n \in \bb{Z}\}$ then $G = \struct{a}$ is a \itl{cyclic group} generated by $a$.
    \item Every cyclic group is Abelian.
    \item The \itl{Division Algorithm}: if $m \in \bb{Z}^+$ and $n \in \bb{Z}$, then there exists unique $q,r \in \bb{Z}$ such that
    \[
        n = mq + r \tand 0 \leq r < m.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Thm. Cyclic Subgroups are Cyclic}
A subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be a cyclic group, say $G = \struct{a}$, where $a \in G$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Since $H \subseteq G$, every element of $H$ must be a power of $a$. Consider the \itl{smallest} positive power of $a$, $a^m \in H$, for $m \in \bb{Z}^+$. Let $a^n \in H \tfor n \in \bb{Z}$.

    By the division algorithm, there exists unique, $\exists! q,r \in \bb{Z}$ such that $n = mq+r$ where $0 \leq r < m$. Then,
    \begin{align*}
        a^n & = a^{mq+r} = a^{mq}a^r \\
        a^r & = a^{-mq}a^n = (a^m)^{-q}a^n
    \end{align*}
    Since we know that $a^m \in H$, we know that $(a^m)^{-q} \in H$. We also asserted that $a^n \in H$. Thus, we can conclude that $a^r \in H$. But $0 \leq r < m$, and $m$ is the \itl{smallest} positive integer such that $a^m \in H$. Thus $r = 0$. So,
    \begin{align*}
        n & = mq + 0 = mq \\
        a^n & = a^{mq}
    \end{align*}
    Thus every element of $H$ takes the form $(a^m)^q$, and $H$ is cyclic, with generator $\struct{a^m}$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Def. Cyclic Group of Order n}
If $G$ is a cyclic group of \itl{order} $n$, then
\[
    G = \struct{a} = \underbrace{\{e = a^0, a^1, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}}_{n~\text{elements}} \tand a^n = e.
\]
We say the \itl{order of $a$ is $n$}, meaning $a^n = e$. Otherwise, the order of $a$ is infinite, and hence the order of $G$ is infinite.
