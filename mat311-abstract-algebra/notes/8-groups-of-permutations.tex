\section{Groups of Permutations}

\bld{IDEA}: A \itl{permutation} of a set can be thought of as a rearrangement of the elements of the set.

\subsubsection{Def. Permutation}
A permutation of a set $A$ is a function $\phi: A \rightarrow A$ that is both one-to-one and onto. This means $\phi$ is a bijection from $A$ to itself.

Note: We will use "tabular notation" for $\phi$.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Let $A = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and consider two permutations of $A$: 

$f = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
    6 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}$ and $g = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
    2 & 3 & 1 & 6 & 5 & 4
\end{pmatrix}$. Note that the operation of \itl{permutation multiplication} is function composition. That is, $fg = f \circ g$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $fg = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
        1 & 3 & 6 & 2 & 4 & 5
    \end{pmatrix}$
    \item $g^2f = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
        6 & 3 & 2 & 5 & 4 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}$
    \item $f^{-1}g = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
        6 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 5
    \end{pmatrix}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Thm. Permutations Multiplication and Groups}
Let $A$ be a nonempty set and let $S_A$ be the collection of all permutations of $A$. Then $S_A$ is a group under permutation multiplication.
\begin{proof}
    Note Permutation Multiplication is a binary operation on $S_A$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\mathfrak{G}_1$] Let $f,g,h \in S_A$. Let $a \in A$
        \begin{align*}
            [f(gh)](a) & = [f \circ (g \circ h)](a) \\
            & = f((g\circ h)(a)) \\
            & = f(g(h(a))) = (f\circ g)h(a) = [(fg)h](a)
        \end{align*}
        $\therefore \group{S_A, +}$ is associative.
        \item[$\mathfrak{G}_2$] Let $i(a) = a$ for all $a \in A$. Then $i$ is the identity permutation.
        \item[$\mathfrak{G}_3$] Every permutation in $S_A$ is bijective, so every permutation has an inverse.
    \end{itemize}
    $\therefore S_A$ is a group.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Def. Symmetric Group}
Let $A$ be the finite set $A =\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$. The group of all permutations of $A$ is called the \bld{symmetric group}, denoted $S_n$.

Note: $|S_n| = n!$

\subsubsection*{Example}
Consider $S_3$, which would be the group of all permutations of the set $A = \{1,2,3\}$. This set is also known as $D_3$, the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle, where a symmetry is a movement of a shape to make it coincide with its former position. The letter $D$ is used because this type of group is called a \itl{dihedral group}, which are the groups of symmetries of regular polygons that include rotations and reflections.

Labeling the vertices of the triangle $1,2, \tand 3$, we get the following, where $\rho$ are rotations and $\mu$ are reflections.
\begin{align*}
    \rho_0 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        1 & 2 & 3
    \end{pmatrix} & \mu_1 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        1 & 3 & 2
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    \rho_1 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        2 & 3 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} & \mu_2 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        3 & 2 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    \rho_2 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        3 & 1 & 2
    \end{pmatrix} & \mu_3 & = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        2 & 1 & 3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
However, when we consider $D_4$, the dihedral group consisting of symmetries of a square, we notice that $S_4 \neq D_4$.
