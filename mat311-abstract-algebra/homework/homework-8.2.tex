Let $A$ be a set and let $\sigma \in S_A$. For a fixed $a \in A$, the set
\[
    \mathcal{O}_{a.\sigma} = \{\sigma^n(a) : n \in \bb{Z}\}
\]
is the \bld{orbit} of $a$ \bld{under} $\sigma$. In Exercises 11 through 13, find the orbit of 1 under the permutation defined prior to Exercise 1.
\begin{enumerate}
    \qitem{11}{$\sigma$}{$1 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 5 \mapsto 6 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 1$}
    \qitem{12}{$\tau$}{$1 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 1$}
    \qitem{13}{$\mu$}{$1 \mapsto 5 \mapsto 1$}
    \qitem{14}{In Table 8.8, we used $\rho_0,\rho_1,\rho_2,\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3$ as the names of the 6 elements of $S_3$. Some authors use the notations $\epsilon,\rho,\rho^2,\phi,\rho\phi,\rho^2\phi$ for these elements. Verify \itl{geometrically} that their six expression do give all of $S_3$.

    }{They do, with isomorphism $X$, where
    \begin{align*}

        X(\rho_1) & = \rho      & X(\mu_2) & = \rho\phi \\
        X(\rho_2) & = \rho^2    & X(\mu_3) & = \rho^2\phi

    \qitem{16}{Find the number of elements in the set $\{\sigma \in S_4 : \sigma(3) = 3\}$.}{
        Rationale: Since 3 is fixed such that $\sigma(3) = 3$, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three elements. So $|\{\sigma \in S_4 : \sigma(3) = 3\}| = 3! = 6$.

    \qitem{17}{Find the number of elements in the set $\{\sigma \in S_5 : \sigma(2) = 5\}$.}{
        Rationale: Since 2 is fixed such that $\sigma(2) = 5$, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the remaining four elements. So $|\{\sigma \in S_5 : \sigma(2) = 5\}| = 4! = 24$.

In this section we discussed the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle and of a square. In Exercises 23 through 26, give a group that we have discussed in the text that is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the indicated figure. You may want to label some special points on the figure, write some permutations corresponding to symmetries, and compute some products of permutations.

    \qitem{23}{The figure in Fig. 8.21 (a)}{This figure's symmetries are equivalent to $S_2$. Consider labeling the top left branch $1$, and the top right branch $2$.}
    \qitem{24}{The figure in Fig. 8.21 (b)}{This figure's symmetries are equivalent to $D_4$, excluding diagonal reflection.
    
    Consider labeling, according to the hours of a clock, the following: 12 o'clock as 1, 3 o'clock as 2, 6 o'clock as 3, and 9 o'clock as 4.}
    \qitem{25}{The figure in Fig. 8.21 (b)}{This figure's symmetries are equivalent to $D_4$. Consider labeling the ends with 1, 2, 3, and 4.}
    \qitem{26}{The figure in Fig. 8.21 (b)}{This figure's symmetries are equivalent to $\group{\bb{Z}, +}$. Consider picking a starting point as 0, and shifting to the left until the figure is symmetric increases the labeling by 1, and shifting to the right decreases the labeling by 1.}
