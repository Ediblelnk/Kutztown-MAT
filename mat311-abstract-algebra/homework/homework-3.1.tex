\begin{enumerate}
    \qitem{1}{What three things must be check to determine whether a function $\phi: S \mapsto S'$ is an isomorphism of a binary structure $\langle S, * \rangle \twith \langle S', *' \rangle$?}{$\phi$ must be \itl{one-to-one}, \itl{onto}, and \itl{operation preserving}.}
\end{enumerate}
In Exercises 2 through 10, determine whether the given map $\phi$ is an isomorphism of the first binary structure with the second. If it is not an isomorphism, why not?
\begin{enumerate}
    \qitem{3}{$\struct{\bb{Z},+} \twith \struct{\bb{Z},+} \twhere \phi(n) = 2n \tfor n \in \bb{Z}$}{
        An isomorphism must be one-to-one, onto, and operation preserving.
        \begin{proof}
            Onto: Let $y \in \bb{Z}$. Let us find $n \in \bb{Z}$ such that $y = \phi(x)$
            \begin{align*}
                y & = \phi(n) \\
                y & = 2n \\
                y/2 & = n
            \end{align*}
            $y/2$ is not always an integer, so we cannot say that $\phi$ is onto. Therefore, $\phi$ is not an isomorphism between $\struct{\bb{Z},+} \tand \struct{\bb{Z},+}$.
        \end{proof}
    }
    \qitem{5}{$\struct{\bb{Q},+} \twith \struct{\bb{Q},+} \twhere \phi(x) = x/2 \tfor x \in \bb{Q}$}{
        An isomorphism must be one-to-one, onto, and operation preserving.
        \begin{proof}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item One-to-one: Assume $\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)$ for some $x_1,x_2 \in \bb{Q}$.
                \begin{align*}
                    \phi(x_1) & = \phi(x_2) \\
                    \frac{x_1}{2} & = \frac{x_2}{2} \\
                    x_1 & = x_2
                \end{align*}
                Thus $\phi$ is one-to-one.
                \item Onto: Let $y \in \bb{Q}$. Let us find $x \in \bb{Q}$ such that $y = \phi(x)$
                \begin{align*}
                    y & = \phi(x) \\
                    y & = \frac{x}{2} \\
                    2y & = x
                \end{align*}
                Choose $x = 2y$. Thus $\phi$ is onto.
                \item Operation Preserving: Need to show that $\phi(x+y) = \phi(x) + \phi(y)$.
                \begin{align*}
                    \phi(x+y) & = \frac{x+y}{2} \\
                    & = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{2} \\
                    & = \phi(x) + \phi(y)
                \end{align*}
                Thus $\phi$ is operation preserving.
            \end{enumerate}
            Since $\phi$ is one-to-one, onto, and operation preserving, it is an isomorphism between $\struct{\bb{Q},+} \tand \struct{\bb{Q},+}$.
        \end{proof}

    \qitem{7}{$\struct{\bb{R},\cdot} \twith \struct{\bb{R},\cdot} \twhere \phi(x) = x^3 \tfor x \in \bb{R}$}{
        An isomorphism must be one-to-one, onto, and operation preserving.
        \begin{proof}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item One-to-one: Assume $\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)$ for some $x_1,x_2 \in \bb{R}$.
                \begin{align*}
                    \phi(x_1) & = \phi(x_2) \\
                    x_1^3 & = x_2^3 \\
                    x_1 & = x_2
                \end{align*}
                Thus $\phi$ is one-to-one.
                \item Onto: Let $y \in \bb{R}$. Let us find $x \in \bb{R}$ such that $y = \phi(x)$.

                    y & = \phi(x) \\
                    y & = x^3 \\
                    \sqrt[3]{y} & = x
                \end{align*}
                Choose $x = \sqrt[3]{x}$. Thus $\phi$ is onto.
                \item Operation Preserving: Need to show that $\phi(x \cdot y) = \phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)$.
                \begin{align*}
                    \phi(x \cdot y) & = (xy)^3 \\
                    & = x^3 \cdot y^3 \\
                    & = \phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)
                \end{align*}
                Thus $\phi$ is operation preserving.

    \qitem{25}{Continuing the ideas of Exercise 24 can a binary structure have the left identity element $e_L$ and a right identity element $e_R$ where $e_L \neq e_R$? If so, given an example, using an operation on a finite set $S$. If not, prove that it is impossible.}{
        We shall conduct a proof by contradiction
        \begin{proof}
            Let $e_L \tand e_R$ be left- and right-sided identities, respectively, such that $e_L \neq e_R$. Let us consider $e_L * e_R$.
            \begin{align*}
                e_L * e_R & = e_L && \text{since $e_R$ is an identity from the right} \\
                e_L * e_R & = e_R && \text{since $e_L$ is an identity from the left}
            \end{align*}
            Since a binary structure is uniquely defined, we must conclude that $e_L = e_R$. However, this contradicts our assertion that $e_L \neq e_R$. Therefore, there \itl{cannot} be a binary structure such that the left identity and right identity are distinct.
        \end{proof}
