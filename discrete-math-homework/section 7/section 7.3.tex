\section*{Section 7.3}

\subsection*{7.3.1}
\begin{lstlisting}
CountValuesLessThanT

Input: a1, a2,...,an
  n, the length of the sequence.
  T, a target value.
Output: The number of values in the sequence that are less than T.

count := 0

For i = 1 to n
  If ( ai < T ), count := count + 1
End-for

Return( count )
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \biitem{a}{Characterize the asymptotic growth of the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm. Justify your answer.}
  \begin{proof}
    For any input of size $n$, the loop in the algorithm will execute $n$ times, which is at worst $n$. Therefore the number of operations in the worst case is $cn + d$, which is $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{7.3.2}
\begin{lstlisting}
MaximumSubsequenceSum

Input: a1, a2,...,an
  n, the length of the sequence.
Output: The value of the maximum subsequence sum.

maxSum := 0

For i = 1 to n
  thisSum := 0
  For j = i to n
    thisSum := thisSum + aj
    If ( thisSum > maxSum ), maxSum := thisSum
  End-for
End-for

Return( maxSum )
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \biitem{a}{Characterize the asymptotic growth of the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm. Justify your answer.}
  \begin{proof}
    For any input of size $n$, the outer loop in the algorithm will execute $n$ times, which is at worst $n$. The inner loop will execute $n-j$ times, which is at worst $n$. Therefore the number of operations in the worst case is $cn^2 + dn + f$, which is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.
  \end{proof}
  \biitem{b}{Can you find an algorithm that solves the same problem whose worst-case time complexity is linear?}
  \begin{lstlisting}
MaximumSubsequenceSumLinear

Input: a1, a2,...,an
  n, the length of the sequence.
  Output: The value of the maximum subsequence sum.

maxSum := a1
thisSum := a1

For i = 2 to n
  thisSum := max( ai, thisSum + ai )
  maxSum := max( maxSum, thisSum )
End-for

Return( maxSum )
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{7.3.3}
\begin{lstlisting}
FindMaxFunctionValue

Input: a1, a2,...,an
  n, the length of the sequence.
Output: The largest values of M on input values from the sequence.

max := M(a1, a1, a1)

For i = 1 to n
  For j = 1 to n
    For k = 1 to n
      new := M(ai, aj, ak)
      If ( new > max ), max := new
    End-for
  End-for
End-for

Return( max )
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \biitem{a}{Characterize the asymptotic growth of the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm. Justify your answer.}
  \begin{proof}
    For any input of size $n$, the outer loop in the algorithm will execute $n$. The middle loop will execute $n$ times. The innermost loop will execute $n$ times. Therefore the number of operations in the worst case is $an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$, which is $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
